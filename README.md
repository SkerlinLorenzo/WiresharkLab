<h1>Network Packet Analysis</h1>



<h2>Description</h2>
In this Wireshark project, I conducted a comprehensive network traffic analysis by launching a capture and meticulously observing the data transmitted over the network. I then utilized fundamental filtering techniques to efficiently sort through the collected data, enabling a systematic and targeted examination of the network packets. Through this process, I gained valuable insights into the communication patterns and data flow within the network, fostering a deeper understanding of its operational dynamics and potential security implications.
